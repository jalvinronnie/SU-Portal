When BPHC took its first breath in 2008, it was the Chemistry Department that started the Chemistry Association ‘Alchemy’, the first association of campus. The significance of the name is rooted in all the works that it has done till yet. Our first Director, Dr. V.S. Rao was from Chemistry Department itself! Coming to the works that the association does, it is the only association that publishes biweekly newsletter ‘Chemazine’ regularly. It also publishes semseter magazine ‘Elixir’ which contains some stuff that can literally amaze you like nothing else. In our techno-management fest, ATMOS, it conducts many events that pull attention like a concert. With the headliner ‘ Chem –Hunt’ and fun filled filler events, the association promises to lighten up your information and mood this ATMOS , just like we do it every year; but this year it’s going to be more than magic. Stay bonded!  <br>
