                    <p class="info more">If you say alchemy is the link between immemorial magic arts and modern
                        science, you are correct. If you say it is humankind’s first systematic effort to unlock the
                        secrets of matter by reproducible experiments, you are more than correct!
                        When BPHC took its first breath in 2008, it was the Chemistry Department that started the
                        Chemistry Association ‘Alchemy’, the first association of campus. The significance of the name
                        is rooted in all the works that it has done till yet. Our first Director, Dr. V.S. Rao was from
                        Chemistry Department itself! Coming to the works that the association does, it is the only
                        association that publishes biweekly newsletter ‘Chemazine’ regularly. It also publishes semseter
                        magazine ‘Elixir’ which contains some stuff that can literally amaze you like nothing else. In
                        our techno-management fest, ATMOS, it conducts many events that pull attention like a concert.
                        With the headliner ‘ Chem –Hunt’ and fun filled filler events, the association promises to
                        lighten up your information and mood this ATMOS , just like we do it every year; but this year
                        it’s going to be more than magic. Stay bonded! <br>
