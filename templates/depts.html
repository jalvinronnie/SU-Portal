Despite being a department only for ARENA, its absence takes away a significant chunk of the success the fest entails. From the smallest jobs like setting up tents and issuing ID cards to the biggest like escorting of guests and security related affairs for any events and pro shows, coordinating between teams, captains and sports secretaries for and providing the hospitality to participants, scheduling games, issuing prize money and certificates, everything that is done, is done by this department alone. Firewallz’s responsibilities other than the above include organizing the inauguration ceremony of ARENA, tracking of losses and damage accurately by handling inventory with utmost caution, scheduling games and matches, verification of details, setting rules and regulations for everyone to follow, etc. The smooth sailing fest happens only because of the ardent cooperation of the department of firewallz and hence it got its title as the backbone of ARENA.</p>
