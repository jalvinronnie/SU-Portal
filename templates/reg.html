                    own. This Sangam helps organize the Pongal Celebration in the campus, that will culminate in a feast
                    for Tamils and non-Tamils alike. In addition, an informal meet will be planned every year, for the
                    Tamil spirit of togetherness and friendship to last beyond our college years.</p>
