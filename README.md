To set up the dev env: `tools/setup`. This script will create the
virtualenv and install the required dependencies.

To set up the dev database: `tools/setup_db`. This script will
create a new database and a new mysql user for testing.

To activate the virtualenv: `source tools/activate`. You will need
to run this step in any new terminal session you start.

Also, whenever a new dependency is added to the `requirements.txt`
